# modevapp: **mod**el **ev**aluation **app**

This repo contains the code for a Shiny app that uses the 'modEvA' R package to show how some evaluation metrics of species distribution models change with user-defined parameters such as threshold values.

The app is available at https://ambiogeo.shinyapps.io/modevapp.

Check back for new features, as both app and repo are occasionally updated. Feedback welcome!
